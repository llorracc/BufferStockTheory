		  greatly depending on how the shock is distributed across

  abstract	= {The goal of this chapter is to study how, and by how much,
		  household income, wealth, and preference heterogeneity
		  amplify and propagate a macroeconomic shock. We focus on
		  the U.S. Great Recession of 2007-2009 and proceed in two
		  steps. First, using data from the Panel Study of Income
		  Dynamics, we document the patterns of household income,
		  consumption and wealth inequality before and during the
		  Great Recession. We then investigate how households in
		  different segments of the wealth distribution were affected
		  by income declines, and how they changed their expenditures
		  differentially during the aggregate downturn. Motivated by
		  this evidence, we study several variants of a standard
		  heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and an
		  endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our key
		  finding is that wealth inequality can significantly amplify
		  the impact of an aggregate shock, and it does so if the
		  distribution features a sufficiently large fraction of
		  households with very little net worth that sharply increase
		  their saving (i.e. they are not hand-to mouth) as the
		  recession hits. We document that both these features are
		  observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role that
		  social insurance policies, such as unemployment insurance,
		  play in shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth
		  distribution, and through it, the dynamics of business
		  cycles.},
